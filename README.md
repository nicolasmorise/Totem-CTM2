# Totem CTM2

**Totem CTM2** is an interactive web application developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to run on touchscreen kiosks at the **Missionary Training Center (CTM)**. It was created to help missionaries easily access information about their assigned missions using a user-friendly, touch-based interface.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed to solve a practical problem at the CTM. The center had several touchscreen TVs that were underutilized. Totem CTM2 transformed these devices into interactive kiosks, allowing missionaries to:

- Search and explore mission destinations.
- View details such as location, map, climate, culture, and more.
- Interact with the system directly via touch.

All mission data is stored in local **JSON files**, enabling fast access and offline usage, ideal for internal deployment.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main structure and UI of the kiosk app.
- `style.css` – Styling for layout, responsiveness, and touch-friendly interaction.
- `script.js` – Handles all app interactivity and data handling.
- `data/` – Contains all mission-related information in JSON format.
- `assets/` – Includes images, flags, and icons used in the interface.

## 💡 Key Features

- Fully interactive and touch-optimized interface.
- Dynamic mission search by region or country.
- Offline-friendly with local JSON-based data.
- Custom map integration for enhanced visualization.
- Multi-language support ready (PT/EN/ES).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- JSON (for data)

## 🏆 Impact

This project improved internal engagement by giving missionaries quick and interactive access to mission info. It repurposed unused touchscreen TVs at the CTM, transforming them into informative kiosks and optimizing technology already available.

If you'd like to tailor either version for a more technical or business-focused audience (e.g. recruiters vs. engineers), I can adapt it accordingly.
